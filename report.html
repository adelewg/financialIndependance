    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a website that I built for a ficticious investment club whose members are current and former MBA students that are interested in the early financial independance movement. Most of the members of this club will be based in Kenya although they could be anywhere really. Financial independance is a financial satus whereby one's investments are earning enough income to cover reasonable living expenses without having to rely on formal employment. The aim of the society is to emplower students and for them to come together and share knowledge and expertise so as to have a greater sense of autonomy and control over their financial choices. I was insipired by my interest in finance, the number crunching that underpins finance, investments and the technological changes that are shifting how we invest. Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch are some my professional inspirations as well. </p>
    <p>The structure that I chose to implement was a five page website consisting of the homepage, recommended books, investing, contact us page and a calculator for calculating how well you doing to hit retirement goals. I decided to go for a very simple structure because the attention span of my users is very short so I just wanted to focus on creating a good user experience. The subpages on the site did not link to any other additional sites hence overall a very simple structure that ensures all the information is easy for the user to find.</p>
    <h2>3 sources of Insiration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The financial Times: Financial publication in the UK</li>
        <li>CityAM</li>
        <li>Blogs on financial independance and the FIRE movement. In particular a blog called "Playing with Fire"</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Accessibility of the site</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Images - for users with disabilities such as visual impairments I have included explanatory text imbedded in the html for all images on my site. Users that use screen readers can have the information read aloud to them. Providing alt text means that the accessibility is improved.</li>
        <li>I have also designed the website so that it is accessible on different types of devices such as mobile phone screens and tablets in addition to the standared computer screens. I have done this through the use of media querys to rearrange contect according to the width of the device</li>
        <li>I have ensured that the site works even without javascript. So that the javascript is just an additional layer of functionality and even if a user does not have javascript enabled. the site will work just as well</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Making it responsive to different screen sizes</li>
        <li>The Call to Actions buttons - I tried to really make them stand out and also making sure the buttons are clickable even on mobile devices</li>
        <li>Menu navigation. Nav bar is the same on all pages.The sticky navigation bar at the top made it more user friendly as users do not have to scroll to the top all the time they want to navigate away from the page and onto another page of the website. </li>
        <li>Good use of white space and not clutter the page by putting content within a container class. I also when selecting color tried to make sure the colors are contrasting enough so that a user can comfortable read the content on the site</li>
        
    </ol>

    <h2>What I have learned</h2>
    <p>I learned about the importance of planning, the general planning process which includes wireframes and site-map. I now would not undertake the job of building a site without planning it our first.  The course videos were very useful on teaching about wireframing. I also used FreeCodeCamp as a resource as it has free courses and articles on JavaScript and wireframing. I also learned that I can build a nice looking site without necessarily knowing to much about design and the bootstrap library was very useful. Having everything planned out and wireframes drawn maked building a site a very pleasant process. </p>
    <p>Through this course and completing this project, I got to learn about the bootstrap library. I always heard about it but had no idea what it was. I really enjoyed using it to make the site look more professional and polished. The html is not difficult but the CSS I found really challenging to use and to use it in such a way that the site looks professional and visually appealing</p>
    <p>I also learned about the role of JavaScript in websites. Its a client side language that can create interactity on the site and make the user experience that much more dynamic. You can process user input, perform calculations and so much more.</p>

    <h2>What worked well</h2>
    <p> I liked the overall structure of the website and the navigation between the different pages of the sites as well as internal links that could connect to another page in the site</p>
    <p>The colors worked well, they were not jarring. Selecting harmonious colour is very difficult. So though the palette was simple that colours worked well together</p>
    <p>I was also happy with the javascript implementation to validate the contact form and to embed a very simple retirement calculator which really makes sense for a site like this one.</p>
    <h2>What I would do differently</h2>
    <p>On the page for books - I would like the books to be layed out better so that the page is not soo long. So I would have played around with putting the recommended books inside a card with some kind of border and spaced them out betterand I could then lay them out as 2 cards in a row and that would greatly improve the usability of the site. .</p>
    <p>Another thing that I would do differnetly is to improve the retirement calculator to include more complex calculations that involve factors like interest rates and returns on various investment plus factor in age. I would also improve the site by including a graph as an output for the user. More complex calculations would improve the useability of the site but making it more interesting for the user and they could come again and again to the site. Also if the output of my calculator is that the user is doing everything great and hence congratulations - I would like to implement some confetti on the screen. I think that would be really nice because it would also introduce additional color which I think the site needs.</p>
    <p>I would also like the search function to work to let users search for specific information especially as the site gets larger with more information and news.</p>
    <p>I would also like to have on my site a bar on top that shows live information on various stocks with the price and information about if it has moved up or down. I think for this I would need an api and further research on my part.</p>
    <h2>Resources Used</h2>
    <p>My main resource were the <strong>Course Videas</strong> which I watched over and over </p>
    <p>I also used Harvards CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript which explained how to use API's to access data from other websites for example to get access to current forex rates and stock prices. That gave me the idea of embedding some a stock ticker on the top of the page for users to see where various stocks were trading. Unfortunately I did not get this to work for my site and so I just left it out.</p>

    <blockquote> “Real wealth is not about money. Real wealth is: not having to go to meetings, not having to spend time with jerks, not being locked into status games, not feeling like you have to say ‘yes,’ not worrying about others claiming your time and energy. Real wealth is about freedom.” – James Clear</blockquote>
    <p class="lead">Reaching financial independance is the holy grail of personal finance. There are several myths and misconceptions when it comes to financial planning, and individuals can take in a lot of advice from many good and not-so-good sources. Mistakes can range from confusing high incomes with wealth to not knowing the importance of tax asset placement when choosing your investments. Review these key insights that can lead to a more financially independent life. </p>

        <h2>Savings Rate</h2>
        <p class = "lead">Your saving rate is the amount of money you have remaining after spending money on taxes and other life expenses. It’s a powerful metric that can give you insight into whether you’re on the fast track or the slow road to retirement. </p>
        <p class = "lead">Someone living paycheck to paycheck has a saving rate of 0%. Someone who makes $80,000 and saves $40,000 has a saving rate of 50%. The higher the savings rate, the quicker you’ll be able to reach financial independence. The lower the saving rate, the more likely it is that you’ll spend decades trying to get there.</p>
        <p class = "lead">This saving rate is the single biggest predictor of whether you’ll be able to retire early or even retire at all. And there are only two factors that influence your saving rate: how much you earn and how much you spend. </p>

        <h2>Investing the Difference</h2>
        <p class = "lead">Once you start saving money, the next step toward financial independence is to invest. Thanks to inflation, money sitting in your savings account is going to be worth less next year than it is today. People who are striving for financial independence know this and they know that the only way to be financially free is to have their money earn more money through investing. </p>
        <p class = "lead">Investing your money creates a snowball effect. Start with a small snowball of money and let it pick up more snow as it goes. This, in effect, is the power of compounding. Small consistent actions add up over time and. Let your snowball roll down the hill long enough and you’ll end up wealthy. </p>
        <p class = "lead">Investing doesn’t need to be complicated or time-consuming. Many in the FIRE community utilize low-cost index funds — Warren Buffet’s standard investment advice. Others invest in real estate and build a portfolio of rental homes that provide income to live off of in retirement. </p>

        <h2>Tracking Tools</h2>
        <p class = "lead">You can use a tracking tool like Personal Capital so you can see everything together in one beautifully designed interface. We ended up using this as our daily money tracker, so it might make sense for you to simply start using this right out of the gate. The only drawback, as with most free tools online, is the tool is really a gateway to lure you into using their financial advisors. But since you are a super smart member of the FIRE community, you’ll know (soon enough, if not already) that fees are the enemy and you can manage an average investment portfolio all on your own. So, ignore the calls from Personal Capital, and enjoy their tool. It’s pretty amazing, and worth the small hassle.</p>

        <h2>How can you do it?</h2>
        <p class = "lead">Reaching financial independance is not complex at all. And it is certainly not about making a big salary. Its about spending the money that you do make wisely. There are two main points to keep in mind</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Increase your savings rate</li>
          <li>Investing your savings wisely</li>
        </ol>
        <p class = "lead">There are various targets you can set yourself in order to reach financial independance. One of them is to target a pot of money worth 25 times your annual spending amount. So for example if in a year you can get by on $10,000 then your goal is to save a minimum of $250,000</p>
        <p class = "lead">The more you save, or the higher your savings rate the faster you will reach your savings goal.</p>
        <p class = "lead">Another way to look at this goal is the  the 4% rule which states that if you keep you pot of savings invested in a conservative portfolio of shares, you can live of the safe withdrawal rate of 4% a year and your money will never run out</p>
